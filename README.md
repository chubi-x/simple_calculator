# SIMPLE ARITHMETIC CALCULATOR IN RUST

## In this project I build a simple calculator that lets a user perform simple arithmetic functions on two numbers. The system is built in such a way that it runs infinitely unitl the user tells it to stop. I also implement sufficient error handling techniques to ensure that the system does not crash once it encounters an input error but instead lets the user correct it themselves.
## I used the text_io crate to read user input as strings and then convert them to float so the arithmetic functions can be applied.
## For more info on the algorithm, check out the first few lines in the main file.
